# QA (non-happy, lite): declined card, user cancels 3-D Secure, timeout

## Description
We need to run a focused QA sweep on high-risk payment failure paths: declined cards, users canceling the 3-D Secure challenge, and checkout sessions that time out. The objective is to validate that Cherry handles these failure flows gracefully and consistentlyâ€”surfacing clear messaging, protecting the user's trust, and keeping our ledgers clean.

## Why non-happy path testing matters for Cherry
- **User trust**: Clear, friendly messaging and recoverable flows help users understand what went wrong and try again without abandoning Cherry.
- **Financial integrity**: Verifying that failed payments do not create inconsistent ledgers or pending balances keeps our books accurate.
- **Compliance**: Confirming that we respect payment network requirements (e.g., 3-D Secure handling) reduces regulatory risk.
- **Stability**: Exercising edge cases improves resilience, ensuring retries, logs, and telemetry stay healthy even when processors respond with errors or delays.

## Scope & Acceptance Criteria
- Declined card flows display the correct reason, log the event, and offer actionable next steps (e.g., retry, choose another method).
- When the shopper cancels the 3-D Secure challenge, we surface a clear cancellation state and reset the checkout session safely.
- Gateway or network timeouts prompt a helpful message, avoid duplicate charges, and trigger retry/rollback logic as designed.

## Additional Notes
Document observed behavior, screenshots, logs, and any discrepancies so engineering can triage follow-ups quickly.

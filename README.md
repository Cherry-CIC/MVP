## Our Mission

cherry (yes, with a lowercase 'c') is a user-based platform (currently just a mobile app) that combines sustainable fashion with charitable giving.

It allows users to buy and sell pre-loved clothing and accessories, with 100% of the proceeds going directly to charities chosen by the users.

We empower individuals to make a tangible, personal impact on the causes they care about, while promoting a circular economy and reducing the environmental harm and unethical practices caused by the fashion industry.

Through a user-friendly platform and transparency above all, cherry facilitates a seamless, impactful way anyone (with clothes) can support a plethora of great causes, and every purchase contributes to a sustainable, fairer future!

## Our Progress

Our amazing volunteer team have been working hard to take the concept of cherry to an MVP product, proving the value and impact that cherry can have on the fashion industry. Our next steps are to move from MVP to a production ready solution, get real customers on our platform and start creating impact.

### Open Source at Heart

Cherry is built in the open because transparency, collaboration, and shared ownership are core to our mission.

By open-sourcing our platform, we invite the community to help shape a fairer, more sustainable future for fashion and charitable giving. Anyone can contribute, learn from the codebase, and hold us accountable to our values.

Open source isn’t just a technical choice for cherry — it’s a statement about **trust**, **impact**, and **collective responsibility**.
